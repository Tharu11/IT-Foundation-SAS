55_PAS_On 3D Printers
Possible Answer Sheet


Q1. What is a 3D printer? 
Ans: A 3D printer is a new style of printing that we call a three dimensional printer. We create an electronic model, we provide it to the printer and it’s able to provide us with output that we could hold in our hand.


Q2. 3D printer that prints in ____________ dimensions. 
Ans. Three


Q3. We often refer to 3D printers as a ____________________.
Ans. Additive manufacturing.


Q4. What do we do to create a 3D model?
Ans. We use additive manufacturing to start with nothing and add layers until we have the final product to create a 3D model.


Q5. What is additive manufacturing? 
Ans: Additive manufacturing is creating layers upon layers to finally create the 3D model that we see in the final output.


Q6. What are 3D printers being used for? 
Ans: 3D printers are being used for multiple purposes from simple design built on the screen to being used in space stations to create very specialized parts.


Q7. What is a very common type of 3D printing? 
Ans: A very common type of 3D printing is filament printing.


Q8. What does FDM stand for?
Ans. FDM stands for Fused Deposition Modeling. 


Q9. Explain filament printing?
Ans. Filament printing we are melting the filament and placing it in very fine layers to create the 3D object. 


Q10. What are the advantages of using this type of 3D printer? 
Ans: The advantages of using this type of 3D printer is it has a very large print bed.


Q11. How does the filament printer create 3D objects? 
Ans. The filament printer creates 3D objects by using melted filament and goes round and round pouring melted filament starting from the bottom and finishing at top to create a 3D model.


Q12. How does an SLA printer differ from a filament printer? 
Ans. An SLA printer differs from a filament printer because SLA printers can also create these very fine 3D objects, the SLA printing tends to be smoother and more finely detailed than the filament printers.


Q13. What does an SLA printer stand for?
Ans. An SLA printer stands for Stereolithography printer. 


Q14. SLA Printer is often referred to as_____________.
Ans. As a resin printer.


Q15. How does SLA printers work?
Ans. SLA printers work in reverse the liquid resin that sits on the bottom of the printer, and the object that we are printing is attached to a build platform that moves up and down.


Q16. There’s __________that sits on the bottom of this SLA printer, and the object that you’re printing is attached to a ___________that moves up and down.
Ans. Liquid resin and build platform.


Q17. What is the biggest challenge with resin printing? 
Ans: The biggest challenge with resin printing tends to revolve around how we manage the liquid resin. 


Q18. You have to use_______________, so that you don’t injure yourself when working with the resin.
Ans.  Protective gear.


Q19. What should you do with leftover resin? 
Ans: We leftover resin. We need to dispose of them by taking them to a hazardous materials facility in our area.


Q20. What do we refer to as the large surface used for 3D printing? 
Ans: We refer to the large surface used for 3D printing as a print bed.


Q21. _________________ is a flat surface, and it usually is either adhesive on the bottom with your filament printing or adhesive on the top, so that you’re able to connect it to the build platform with resin printing.
Ans. A print bed.


Q22. What needs to be done to the print bed to ensure a successful print? 
Ans: Everything needs to be level to ensure a successful print.


Q23. What is the print bed for filament printing? 
Ans: The print bed for filament printing is either adhesive on the bottom or on the top.


Q24. What is the print bed typically made of? 
Ans: The print bed is typically made of something that is relatively sticky or makes it very difficult for the object to move.


Q25. Are there different options for print beds? 
Ans: There are a lot of different options for print bed, and we can find some that are very large and some that are more compact.


Q26. What is the print bed in resin printing? 
Ans: The print bed in resin printing is the very small area at the bottom of this printer where the light is able to harden the resin.
